### AUTOENCODERS

Autoencoders are a special type of neural network architecture where the output aims to replicate the input. These networks are trained in an unsupervised fashion to learn compressed representations of the input data. The compressed features are then decoded to reconstruct the original input. In essence, autoencoders learn to predict their own input, effectively modeling the identity function. The network's structure includes a narrow bottleneck layer with fewer neurons, forcing it to capture key patterns and compress the input data into a lower-dimensional code. This code is then used by the decoder to reconstruct the input.

A typical autoencoder consists of three main components:

1. **Encoding Architecture**: A series of layers with a decreasing number of nodes, ending with a latent representation.

2. **Latent Representation**: A compact, low-dimensional representation of the input, where key information is preserved.

3. **Decoding Architecture**: A mirror of the encoding architecture, where each layer has an increasing number of nodes, ultimately producing an output that approximates the original input.

The autoencoder architecture used for image reconstruction in this notebook is outlined below:
